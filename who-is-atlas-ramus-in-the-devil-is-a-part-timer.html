While she may be the “appointed daughter” of Sadao Maou and Emi Yusa, she plays a bigger role than just a “loli anime character.” This young child is actually a fragment of Yesod, a piece that forms the Tree of Life.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=788 data-injectable=true>Fragments of Yesod have scattered across Ente Isla thanks to the angel, Lailah, as she wanted to preserve the Tree of Life from angels overusing its power. The fragment that contained Atlas was given to Sadao Maou 300 years before he became king of the Demons. He was rescued by this angel and given a purple crescent-shaped crystal that he kept safe in his castle. After he left with Ashiya, Lailah entered and sent the shard to Earth, where it would find its way to Sadao and Emi.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>While Atlas mostly takes the form of a child, she actually plays a bigger role in the world of Ente Isla.
