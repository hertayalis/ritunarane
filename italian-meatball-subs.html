There’s something so warm and comforting about eating a hearty meatball sub covered in rich tomato sauce, melted cheese, all on buttery toasted bread.

It all starts with making a juicy, flavorful meatball.&nbsp; It takes some quality ground beef, a good amount of seasoning, fresh herbs, panko bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and an egg to bind it all together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Italian-Meatball-Subs-3-crop.jpg alt="Italian Meatball Subs.

Then the meatballs are added to a simmering pot of marinara to fully cook the meatball.&nbsp; This is what keeps it nice and juicy! Also, browning the meatballs brings out the flavor.</p><p>This is the best meatball sub recipe on the planet!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Italian-Meatball-Subs-7.jpg alt="Italian Meatball Subs.

If you use 85/15, it will be a tad less juicy meatball).&nbsp; Mix ground beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, panko bread crumbs, fresh parsley, egg, and parmesan cheese in a bowl. I like to use my hands to get it really incorporated together.</li><li><strong>Roll the meatball mixture into large balls, depending on the desired size</strong>. Heat extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated, add the meatballs and cook for 5-7 minutes, turning once to brown both sides.</li><li><strong>Meanwhile, make your own homemade marinara sauce or heat jarred marinara sauce in a large pot</strong>.&nbsp; Once the meatballs have browned, remove from the oil and place in the pot of simmering marinara sauce.&nbsp; Let cook on low heat for about 20 minutes, or until meatballs are cooked through.</li><li><strong>Cut bread in half, making sure not to cut all the way through</strong>. Spread butter over both sides of the bread.&nbsp; Put oven on the broil setting. Heat until the butter is completely melted and remove from the oven. Watch carefully as it can easily burn.</li><li><strong>Place cooked meatballs and sauce onto the bread and generously cover with mozzarella cheese</strong>. Return to the oven and cook until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Top with fresh Italian parsley and serve immediately with extra sauce on the side for dipping. If you want some extra spice, top with some marinated Italian peppers.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Italian-Meatball-Subs-Recipe.jpg alt="Italian Meatball Subs.
