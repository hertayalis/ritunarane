William wasn’t keen," Omid Scobie wrote in his new book,&nbsp;Endgame. "This was his moment with the public, but the King put pressure on [him]."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The walkabout was also the catalyst for another major moment: William apparently sent Harry a text for the first time in months. Scobie explained that William “sent his first text message in months to Harry, suggesting it would be ‘good’ if they came along, too.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, Scobie wrote that a source close to the royals "said it was all led by their father, that he was the one that made the suggestion."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It showed that all four are capable of switching it on and doing what’s right in the moment," Scobie said of the walkabout, which was the first time in years that the Big 4 had been at an event together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I thought potentially that could open doors to other moments of seeing what matters and putting certain things to one side, just to coexist or to find some sort of common ground,” he added. “But I think the thing that surprised me the most was that afterward everyone just went their own ways and nothing happened beyond that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scobie also wrote that the Sussexes only had 40 minutes' notice before they were expected to join the Cambridges. That, he explains, was a major signal that William was brushing off the whole thing and didn't want Harry to be involved.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The fact that it was about to go ahead without the Sussexes, who were only asked 40 minutes beforehand, shows just how close William was to not doing it at all. And if it wasn't for Charles, it wouldn't have [happened],” Scobie added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, a source close to Kensington Palace told&nbsp;People&nbsp;that having everyone together "was an important show of unity at an incredibly difficult time for the family."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ugp5uVYsSquMuimKZllJ6xr8CMsJinrF2pvG61za%2BgrZ1dna6zvthmrqKmlKi8s3nWmqOkmZKkwrV50K6cnqZdmrmqxsCbnK2gXZmyosDHZm9taGhrhnk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
