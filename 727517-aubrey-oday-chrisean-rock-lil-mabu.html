One user replied: "The industry did itself such a disservice when it allowed streaming and TikTok to affect the charts. Anyone with a social media following can be an artist now. It’s sad because real talent is being overlooked for trends. Smh." Another wrote: "Thank you @AubreyODay! I have been saying the same thing about this garbage being put out as music when so many artists had to work hard and know how to put on a good show!"

She raps: "Only thing that's broke is my f*cking water/Gave birth to my kid but I hate his father/I used to f*ck wit Blue's now I f*ck wit ones/Only f*ck with white boys that be toting guns."
