According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Deadline</a>, Bianca's exit from the show was brought about by a scheduling conflict, as the youngster was busy filming for an Apple TV+ limited series titled, Lady In the Lake.</p><p id=eeblcAqO5_l data-wc=53>As a result, the role of Katie Townsend has now gone to Ella Grace Helton. Despite her young age, the budding actress has already starred in the American sitcom, United We Fall&nbsp;(2020), starring Will Sasso and Christina Vidal Mitchell. And she's also landed roles in Hubie Halloween (2022) and Chosen Family (2023).&nbsp;</p><p id=eUtGwc6wWb data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Sweet Magnolias is back for season 3 - see first trailer</a></p><p id=ew5o1wb6zo data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>All there is to know about JoAnna Garcia Swisher's husband and children</a></p><p id=er0kahJ4frz data-wc=38>Back in June, the trailer for series three was released by Netflix, and it looks like there's no shortage of drama in the southern town of Serenity.

The official synopsis reads: "Following the brawl at Sullivan's, Maddie wrestles with the best way to help Cal and works to clear her own emotional path. Helen faces difficult decisions about the men in her life.&nbsp;</p><p id=eF6e-Iy1Hsd data-wc=75>"And Dana Sue searches for a way to use Miss Frances' check to help the community, without upending her family. The identity of the tire slasher sends shockwaves through Serenity, the recall causes unexpected consequences, and there are romantic surprises in every generation. Throughout the season, the ladies tackle these problems -- and all the complications they cause - with their trademark warmth, humor, and devotion to each other and those they love. And margaritas."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/5974b6f9c23b-sweet-magnolias-cast.jpg><p id=etwDfbYnQV2 data-wc=18>Scheduled to premiere on July 20, it won't be long before Sweet Magnolias is back on our screens.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXpiUHdBO5p data-wc=43>Speaking about what to expect from season 3, JoAnna Garcia told The List: "It's definitely going to not disappoint the Sweet Magnolias fans. There's a lot of love and romance, and you're going to get to see a deeper side of our friendship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9b5cd0f91061-sweetmagnoliasns3e700240312rc.jpg><p id=ep7aP6jqoFV data-wc=44>"For my character, you start to see a little bit more self-reflection. She's coming out of that dark cloud of divorce and seeing where she's landing. Towards the end, you start to see that there is a glimmer of what's to come for Maddie.</p><p id=emOQNdWhIMt data-wc=82>She continued: "This season, you're going to see a deeper side of their friendship. It's not always rainbows and butterflies, and sometimes there's some cloudy days. That's an important element and something that's really real, and I think it was about time that we honored that. You start to see how they struggle through life together, with each other, with other people, and it's a tribute to strong female friendships. ... This is a really relatable show. I'm so proud of it."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcHFoZmh8tMPEnqtmpZGcu7C4yJqqZquklr9ursiapZyZXZeys77YZquaqpGjwaq6zmajnpmmmsBuv8eormaqlZiutMDIp55mnp%2Bneqyt06KcZqyfrLu0sc2dZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
