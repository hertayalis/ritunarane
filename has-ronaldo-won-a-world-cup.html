We can't believe it, and now that he's probably on the last legs of his playing career, the <a href=#>2022 tournament</a> is Ronaldo's final and best chance to raise that prestigious gold trophy in the air.</p><p>The captain started off strong, pushing the national team in the right direction with a victory over Ghana in their opening match. Ronaldo scored a penalty kick during the game, making him the first male player to score in five different World Cups. However, we're not sure how Ronaldo can still contribute to Portgual's first-ever World Cup title â€” why is that? Well, head coach Fernando Santos decided to bench him for the team's 6-1 victory over Switzerland in the round of 16.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Itâ€™s amazing that a 37 year old is still playing at the highest level of football let alone playing World Cups, scoring goals, breaking records and still winning awards yet Ronaldo is still somehow getting so much disrespect. Itâ€™s insaneðŸ˜­</p>â€” Trey (@UTDTrey) <a href=#>December 7, 2022</a></figure><p>When asked about Ronaldo's future with the Portugal national team, Fernando stated it's "something which has to be defined. I have a very close relationship with him, I always have. I've known him since he was 19 at Sporting and then he started to develop in the national squad when I arrived in 2014."</p><p>"Ronaldo and I never misinterpret the human and personal aspect with that of manager and player. I will always consider that he is a very important player to have in the team," he added, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>. "This [disciplinary matter] is something that is finished and solved, it is also important to look at the example of this player's history. He is one of the best players in the world and therefore all we have to do is come [together] collectively."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna60edGopZqklKR6uLvNZphmr5%2BnuaV5wq6n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
