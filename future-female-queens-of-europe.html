The eldest of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, Victoria was born in July 1977, followed by <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Carl Philip</a> in May 1979, and <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Madeleine</a> three years later, in June 1982.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d564eb75dc5-crown-princess-victoria-family-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eVCTnTvg1vs3 data-wc=6><strong>Crown Princess Victoria with her family</strong></p><p id=e4fWk7qXBU5V data-wc=69>Interestingly, there was a period of time when she was not heir apparent, however. Her younger brother became heir to the Swedish throne upon his birth, a position he held for seven months. Everything changed in January 1980 when a change in constitution came into effect, which made the natural birth order the basis for succession. It was from this point forward that Victoria became the nation's future queen.</p><h2>Princess Estelle of Sweden</h2><p id=e1n8dKKOIRWX data-wc=41>Crown Princess Victoria will herself be succeeded by her own daughter, <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Estelle</a>. Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel were married in June 2010 and welcomed little Estelle on 23 February 2012. Their second child, <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Oscar</a>, was born on 2 March 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b3753fd85722-princess-estelle-of-sweden-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ep28J94VevIi data-wc=2><strong>Princess Estelle</strong></p><p id=epuMTou2rxwK data-wc=57>Estelle will make history when she ascends to the throne. She will be the first female in Swedish history to be born with the right to inherit the crown that cannot be superseded by the birth of a male heir, as well as the first person in Swedish history to be born of a female heir apparent.</p><h2>Princess Leonor of Spain</h2><p id=eO60j2vRmfQB data-wc=55><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Leonor</a> is the heir presumptive to the Spanish throne as the eldest daughter of King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia. When she ascends to the throne, the 17-year-old will be the first queen regnant since Isabella II, who reigned from 1833 to 1868. Leonor has a younger sister, Infanta Sofia, who was born in April 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a5247178e6cd-princess-leonor-uwc-atlantic-college-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e-kMJrEEAi2W data-wc=11><strong>Princess Leonor is now studying at UWC Atlantic College in Wales</strong></p><h2>Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway</h2><p id=eqVCFBjdtKKm data-wc=39><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway</a> is the elder child of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, and is currently second-in-line to succeed her grandfather King Harald V.
