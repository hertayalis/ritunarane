Recommended Videos Even Gojo’s attire is shrouded in mystery as the character very rarely reveals his eyes outside of battle, and even then, only when his strongest powers are necessary. But why is that?
While Gojo’s powers are touched upon in the show, fans may be curious exactly what these are, and why he chooses to cover his eyes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Because of the powers these provide in highlighting cursed energy, it can often be too much to see all of the time. Using a blindfold allows him to rest his eyes.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>The Six Eyes is one of the most powerful bloodline traits shown in Jujutsu Kaisen so far and allows its user to manage their cursed energy on another level. This paired with the Limitless ability some Gojo-clan members can use is how Gojo is able to create such a powerful domain expansion.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Even outside of its offensive capabilities when paired with Limitless, the Six Eyes is an unmatched tool on the battlefield as it can give away positions of curse users and allow them to distinguish threats kilometers away.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=false>Right now the limits of this power aren’t known, but perhaps as the manga continues we’ll get a better idea of exactly what barriers there are. Perhaps in future episodes of the show, we will see new abilities come from the Six Eyes, but for now, Gojo is strong enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn7JllKSytHnGqKGoZZOkw6a%2BjKGgrGWVrrK0ecinZKOtmqrBtMGMpJiiq5WjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
