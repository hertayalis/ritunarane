"Well, I was wrong, I was just plain wrong,"&nbsp;he said of his days being a bachelor. "And children, you know. I used to roll my eyes. People would say, 'Oh Hugh you don’t understand it', but they were right."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7bd7afbcf0b8-hugh-grant-anna-eberstein-oscars-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ezmSo1wgv6f data-wc=6><strong>Hugh with his wife Anna Eberstein</strong></p><h2>Does Hugh Grant have children?</h2><p id=eRT0r7HEEA1H data-wc=48>Hugh Grant has five children in total. Anna and Hugh welcomed their first child John Mungo Grant in September 2012 and welcomed their second child&nbsp;- whose name remains unknown - in December 2015.

On becoming a father, Hugh told People TV’s Jess Cagle: "It was the nicest thing that's ever happened to me - he said sounding clichéd - but it happens to be true." He continued: "It's just lovely to have all that love around. Suddenly you love someone more than yourself. It's unheard of in my case and they love you and it's all enchanting."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9bb5ed320197-hugh-grant-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ea-P4F8-nFE8 data-wc=4><strong>Hugh has five children</strong></p><p id=ev5ceVWe80Zt data-wc=44>The star continued to speak of a funny game he likes to play with his sons. "It's always amusing to put your underpants on your head," he said. "My little girl at two likes her nappies on my head."</p><p id=e1fbbNV22vzb data-wc=79>The actor also revealed he once made the mistake of showing his backside to his son for fun but "then he got the habit and taught every single child in West London to do the same!" Speaking to TV host <a class=hm-link href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> about fatherhood back in 2012, Hugh said: "Everyone was right all these years, saying, 'Hugh, why don't you have some children? It changes your life'. Now that I have a child, it is life-changing. I recommend it. Get some!"</p><h2>Where does Hugh Grant live?</h2><p id=ew0eT_YVpT7d data-wc=34>According to , Hugh bought a six-bedroom semi-detached home in London's Chelsea area at the end of 2018.
