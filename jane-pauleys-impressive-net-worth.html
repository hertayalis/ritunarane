Her illustrious career spans back to the early 1970s.</p><p>Pauley’s net worth, as of late 2016, is reported to be $40 million, derived from her extensive work as a television journalist on various shows and the success of her books.</p><h3>Jane Pauley’s Net Worth: $40 million</h3><p>Originally from Indianapolis, Indiana, Pauley is the daughter of Richard Pauley, a traveling salesman, and Mary Pauley, a homemaker. She attended Warren Central High School, where she actively participated in speech and debate competitions, before pursuing a degree in political science at Indiana University.</p><p>Following her college education, Pauley commenced her career as a reporter at WISH-TV. After three years, she departed and made history in 1975 by becoming the first woman anchor on the NBC affiliate network WMAQ-TV. Her early contributions to television not only shaped her career but also significantly enriched her net worth.</p><p>Within 10 months at WMAQ-TV, Pauley was chosen to join “The Today Show” as a replacement for Barbara Walters. At just 25 years old, she became a beloved figure on the show and emerged as one of the most iconic television journalists of her era. Her time on “The Today Show” not only elevated her career to great heights and established her as a household name, but also substantially augmented her wealth.</p><p>In 1989, after 13 years on the show, Pauley departed, expressing her desire to devote more time to her growing family. However, she returned to NBC in 1990 with a new show called “Changes”, later renamed “Real Life with Jane Pauley”. Regrettably, the show only lasted one season due to poor ratings.</p><p>In 1992, Pauley launched another successful show, a newsmagazine titled “Dateline”, which garnered a large and dedicated fan base. Building on this success, she subsequently added another show to her repertoire, “Time and Again”, which aired on MSNBC. Her return to television further expanded her wealth.</p><p>After the unsuccessful “The Jane Pauley Show” in 2004, she utilized her time to publish her first book, “Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue”. This memoir, detailing her life with bipolar disorder, became a bestseller and significantly boosted her net worth.</p><p>Returning to “The Today Show” in 2009, Pauley hosted the weekly segment “Your Life Calling”, featuring individuals aged 50 and above, showcasing their continuous reinvention of life. This segment served as the inspiration for her second book, “Your Life Calling: Reimagining the Rest of Your Life”, which also achieved bestseller status and contributed to her net worth.</p><p>Presently, Pauley remains active as a television journalist, hosting the show “CBS Sunday”. In her personal life, she has been married to Garry Trudeau, the creator of “Doonesbury”, since 1980, and together they have three children.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihmqaVYr2iwcuesKxlmaK9s7HSrKCvnV2jsrV51qipraBf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
