From organic essential oil candles made of beeswax to<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> non-toxic perfumes</a>, fragrance trends really evolved to offer scents that were not only good for the environment, but evoked a sense of comfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But in 2023, industry experts are predicting the pendulum will swing, and we’re going to see (and smell) scents like big, bold florals and creamy, textured vanillas. The best part? The scents trend will resurface with the aforementioned evolved formulas: naturally-derived, eco-friendly, and sustainable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To learn more about the upcoming fragrance trends of 2023, we tapped three industry experts to tell us more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gourmand-vanillas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gourmand Vanillas</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While vanilla is neither a new or trendy ingredient, in 2023 we can expect to see the classic base note reinterpreted in new and stimulating ways via gourmand fragrances. We saw it this last year with the launch ofBillie Eilish’s debut fragrance, Eilish, which piles notes of red berries, mandarin, and cocoa on top of vanilla. And Camron Collard, the Chief Growth Officer of<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Microperfumes</a> — which bottles luxury perfumes from brands like Versace and Creed into affordable, TSA-friendly vessels — predicts we will only continue to see much more of these mouth-watering vanilla-based scents in the next year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In perfumery, vanilla is as classic and foundational as it gets, but so many buzzy contemporary fragrances contain it [and] I can only imagine that the vanilla craze will continue into the new year,” they share.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>For this trend, try: </strong>Eilish by Billie Eilish — $68; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>ulta.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-intense-florals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Intense Florals</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a big departure from the shallow, clean scents we saw in 2022, the new year will usher in fragrances with heart notes made up of intense florals to invoke a romantic, feminine aura. While these scents are nuanced and can contain aromas that go from powdery and sweet to rich and aromatic, the most on-trend floral scents will be “big luminous florals that bring a transportive element and a sense of high quality” says Dara Quinlan, Vice President of Fine Fragrance Development at<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> Firmenich</a>; a fragrance house responsible for developing perfumes for brands like Calvin Klein, Gucci, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For this trend, try: </strong>Alien Goddess by Mugler — $123; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>ulta.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fresh-and-green></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fresh and Green</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It looks like all parts of the flower will make their way into bold fragrances in the new year, as notes of plant leaves will also have their moment. We can also look forward to herbs, fresh-cut grass, moss, green teas, and basically anything that smells green becoming popular.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Following the wellness trend, scents that are green and fresh, signaling a sense of naturality,” will be trending says Quinlan. Because what exudes confidence more than a scent story made of bold, unconventional fragrance notes?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For this trend, try: </strong>REPLICA Matcha Meditation by Maison Margiela — $144; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-elevated-clean></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Elevated Clean</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned, the past few years fragrance-lovers have prioritized scents made of clean ingredients and sustainable packages. And while non-toxic and eco-friendly scents will likely only grow in popularity, customers are looking for more. Specifically fragrances that check the “clean” boxes and are void of things like mineral oils, parades, and silicones — but also offer strong, intense scents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For this trend, try:</strong> Cheerful Charmer by Good Chemistry — $27; target.com</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-layering-oils-and-mists></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Layering Oils and Mists</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starting off with a fine fragrance and then refreshing the scent by layering fragrance oils and mists is going to become more popular than ever.&nbsp;So yes, body sprays are back, and oils will start showing up everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Consumers are embracing a wide array of formats beyond just eau de toilettes (EDTs). Body mists offer a fast and fun way to refresh and layer fragrance throughout the day,” says Qunilan. And Collard agrees: “Fragrance oils for the body are having a bit of a moment right now and the success of Sol de Janeiro has definitely revived interest in the long-maligned body spray category.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For this trend, try:</strong> Brazilian Crush Cheirosa ’71 Hair & Body Fragrance Mist by Sol de Janeiro — $20;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> sephora.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-transportive-candles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Transportive Candles</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travel is back, but in 2023 people will still have the urge to use home fragrances to transport them somewhere else. Comfort candles are out, and luxury transportive candles are in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I personally love to create a scentscape in each room to change the mood based on my space. People like scents that<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> transport them</a>,” says Maison Margiela Fragrances National Fragrance Ambassador Ross Barry. “People are increasingly more informed on what they use in their home and look for lead-free wicks and natural-based waxes in candles. There is also a huge trend in finding candles that have chic vessels that can be reused for make-up brush holders, planters, etc.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For this trend, try:</strong> REPLICA Beach Vibes by Maison Margiela — $65; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57kWlpbGWWp66ovsCnmp5lpKeyr7DSZm1xcWBrgHQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
