You can almost feel the dread emanating from students in a classroom after they're asked to stand-up and talk about themselves in front of everyone. It's a feeling that for some, gets better with time, but there's still that tiny bit of residual fear that's left over from our grade school days."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But when I was in undergrad, getting ready to present a research paper in front of my peers, I felt like the same little elementary nerd with a weird name just hoping a room full of children would accept me.</p><p>That same mini panic attack occurs whenever I'm asked to participate in an "icebreakers" exercise.</p><p>Whether it's a new job orientation, a group project, or some workshop retreat, there's always going to be some program coordinator or instructor there to force everyone into "breaking the ice" with some lame exercises. But not all icebreakers need to be annoying and tiresome. Psych professor Rachel E. Brenner came up with a pretty dope one, as a matter of fact.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Instead of asking students what they did over the summer, or to tell people an "interesting" or "surprising" facts about themselves that they don't think others would know or guess, she asked for the most boring possible personal facts.

People are always more than willing to share their opinions on something, why not give them the opportunity to? I could talk all day about the benefits of Spyder men's boxer briefs, of why Cracker Barrel's Country Boy Breakfast is the greatest meal ever conceived.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>There's something special about the "boring" aspect though, because there's something great about bonding over the fact that everyone in a room is fundamentally not exciting, on some level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But somehow, it all goes back to toothpaste, in the end.
