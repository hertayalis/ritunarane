Zach Wurtenberger, who appeared on season 42 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor</a>, made the comment on X (formerly known as Twitter) after the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cast was announced</a> on July 31.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Survivor fans may recall that Zach Wurtenberger, a superfan of the show, was the first contestant to be voted out of the game. Season 42 of Survivor aired in 2022 and while Zach Wurtenberger was the first person voted out, he wasn’t the first to leave as Jackson Fox was medically eliminated from the game.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>Interestingly enough, Cory Wurtenberger, 21, isn’t the only houseguest on this season of Big Brother with ties to Survivor as he joined Jared Fields, son of the Survivor legend and four-time competitor Cirie Fields, in the Big Brother house. During the premiere on Aug. 2, viewers learned that the first twist of the season was the addition of a 17th houseguest who was none other than Cirie Fields herself.</p><h2 id=h-zach-wurtenberger-said-he-took-away-only-positives-from-his-time-on-survivor-42 data-injectable=false>Zach Wurtenberger said he took away only positives from his time on Survivor 42</h2><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Zach Wurtenberger’s time on reality TV may have been brief but it was very meaningful for the Survivor fan as he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a> in March 2022, “I look at the entire experience so positively. It may be that the three days in the game — at the very least the final day in the game — wasn’t particularly the most fun day of my life.”</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>“When I think about getting to be at Ponderosa afterwards with people and, like, all the pre-game stuff, and getting to live my dream and have all these firsts of getting to go to challenges and tribal and all of that, every single step I just felt so grateful that I had this opportunity,” he added. Wurtenberger also revealed that he’d return to Survivor if he could, as he felt it was “impossible to say no” to the show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What has he said about his brother getting cast on Big Brother 25?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zachary Wurtenberger (@zachwurt)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Zach Wurtenberger couldn’t have been more supportive after news of his younger brother’s casting on Big Brother broke. On July 31, the Survivor alum wrote on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a>, “When we were little, Survivor was always my dream. Cory’s was Big Brother. But even as kids, we knew this wasn’t really possible. They couldn’t cast both of us. That just doesn’t happen.”</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>He added, “I’m so, so proud of my brother [Cory] for becoming the new era Willie Hantz #BB25.” Big Brother fans may recall that Willie Hantz, a season 14 houseguest, was the younger brother of Russell Hantz and the uncle of Brandon Hantz, two multi-season Survivor stars.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Zach Wurtenberger also addressed the interesting twist of his brother having another relative of a Survivor star in the Big Brother house, since Jared Fields is not only Cirie Fields’ son, but he also appeared in 2017 in the 34th season of the show, Survivor: Game Changers, in the visit from loved ones.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Wurtenberger was asked whether he thought his brother would recognize Fields and he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “Wanted to answer this question specifically because I know it could have huge ramifications. Cory has watched Game Changers more than once, and he knows the Jared David vs. Goliath story. My gut says he doesn’t recognize him, but it is totally possible.”</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>The Survivor alum’s support of his little brother carried over to Instagram, where he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a photo</a> of himself and the new Big Brother houseguest. “When a Wurtenberger turns 21, he embarks on his journey to the CBS studio lot,” he joked in the caption. “SO beyond proud of my brother for making his dream come true despite it seeming LITERALLY impossible. Seriously. This isn’t just a big deal, this is unprecedented. Tune into #BB25 this fall to watch him redeem the Wurtenberger name.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What has Cody Wurtenberger said about being cast on Big Brother?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by CBS Big Brother (@bigbrothercbs)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>Wurtenberger is a 21-year-old college student from Weston, Florida. In the intro video for the houseguests shared by the show’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official social media account</a>, he exclaimed, “And in the blue corner, weighing in at 137 pounds of pure power, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it’s Cory. Woo hoo. Yeah!”</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>During his interview with The Exclusive with Sharon Tharp for the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">First Impressions of the New Cast</a>” video, the new reality star said his strategy in the house will be to “lower [his] threat level” as much as possible. He said if he doesn’t win the first HOH, he’d go into “full ‘I’m a child'” mode. “Once I enter that mode, I think people will start looking at me as someone they can bring along as opposed to someone who is going to be this massive force they need to oppose.”</p><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Fans were quick to notice that the younger Wurtenberger didn’t mention his brother in his intro package for Big Brother 25, although Jared Fields brought up his mother’s Survivor connection in his. Many viewers took to X to react to Wurtenberger and Fields’ first meeting, as some wondered whether they recognized each other and were pretending not to. “I’m just trying to analyze cory’s eye movements when he’s looking at jared to see if he recognizes him at all,” one commenter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “Jared and Cory looked like they noticed each other.”</p><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>It’s safe to say that the game will be an uphill battle for Cory Wurtenberger now as the premiere episode on Aug. 2 showed that the 21-year-old is one of the four houseguests nominated for elimination. Wurtenberger was also dragged away at the end of a challenge but was later seen on the live feeds, prompting his older brother to breathe a sigh of relief. “Oh my god thank f*****g god he’s not alone tonight. It’s not about the game, I was just worried sick about him being isolated and miserable. I am so relieved right now, thank god,” Zach Wurtenberger <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What are the Wurtenberger brothers up to now?</h2><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>Cory Wurtenberger is studying political science and communication at Vanderbilt University, his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a> bio shows.
