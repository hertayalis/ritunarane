In a new interview with <a href=#>Forbes</a>, the "Used To Love You" hitmaker admitted she has recorded more than enough songs for an LP. However, due to her lack of "passion," she has decided to hold back for the time being. After getting <a href=#>married to country singer Blake Shelton</a>&nbsp;in 2021, Stefani also wanted to enjoy being a wife again.</p><p dir=ltr>"I just wanted to be in the marriage and try not to do so many things at one time and just be realistic that there are only so many things you can do at one time," she admitted. "So, I kind put it on the back burner but I also feel like sometimes, I don't really have much to say or I don't know if I do — and so, I'm just going to wait and pray about it."</p><p>Stefani's last album was 2017's <a href=#>"You Make It Feel Like Christmas."</a> Prior to that, it was 2016's "This Is What The Truth Feels Like," her first solo album in a decade, per <a href=#>NME</a>. However, as she told <a href=#>Vogue</a> in 2021, she doesn't see herself leaving the scene anytime soon.&nbsp;"This is the thing about age — there are days when you think you're expired. Then there are other days where you're like, I'm not dead. Why stop now? If you don't like it, then turn off the TV or the radio or don't look. I'm still going to do it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnFoaIJze8awnKdlo6myp63NomSgnaSoerOxwKVkmpqfqsFuwMeeZKyskamybrvFZp%2Beql2iwrS1wmaamqqVmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
