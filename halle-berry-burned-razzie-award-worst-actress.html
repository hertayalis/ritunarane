In 2005, Berry was awarded a Razzie for Worst Actress for her performance in 2004's Catwoman—though the actress remained characteristically unfazed. Not only was she in attendance at the awards show that year, but she also took the opportunity to make light of the situation by later burning the award.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Recounting the experience, she told the magazine, "I went to the Razzie [Awards] because I feel like we all take ourselves so seriously. If we get an award, if we get the Oscar, we somehow are made to feel like we're somehow better than everybody else, but we're really not. You were just chosen that year by your peers, and you were acknowledged for doing what they considered stellar work."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was also a subjective award at the end of the day, the actress added. "If you find yourself face-to-face with a Razzie, does that mean you're the worst actor there ever was?" she said. "Probably not. You just got the piss taken out on you that year by a group of people that can.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"If I can show up to collect an Oscar when you're honoring me, I can certainly show up to collect a Razzie when you say, good try, but do better," she continued. "I always learned that if you can't be a good loser, then you don't deserve to be a good winner. So I went there and made fun of myself. I had a great time and then I set that thing on fire. That's what I did!"</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
