After taking several speculated subliminal jabs at one another, Jay decided to <a href=#>throw the first punch</a> in 2001 during Hot 97 FM's Summer Jam, rapping, "Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov. NO."&nbsp;</p><p>Nas' response? He fought back against his adversary on his fifth album, Stillmatic. On "Ether," Nas repeatedly declares "F*** Jay-Z," dubs him the "fake King of New York" and calls him "a fan, a phony, a fake..." You get the idea. He also accuses him of stealing lyrics from Notorious B.I.G.</p><p>Things seemingly went too far when Jay declared he had a fling with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas' daughter, Destiny, during a 2001 freestyle dubbed "Supa Ugly," and Jay's mom <a href=#>reportedly told her son to apologize.</a> He did, saying "I want to apologize to Carmen and any females I may have offended." In 2005, the pair officially buried the hatchet. That year, Jay staged a concert he called "<a href=#>I Declare War</a>" and used it to do the opposite, declaring peace with Nas, signing him to Def Jam and performing "Dead Presidents" and "The World is Yours" with him on stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm5hZoZwr8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BMnJinrF2owaK6w2ahmrFdr3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
