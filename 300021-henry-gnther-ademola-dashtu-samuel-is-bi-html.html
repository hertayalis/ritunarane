Henry's parents renewed their vows on eight different occasions during their 9-year marriage.</p><p class=dh>They also welcomed three children: Two boys and a girl, including Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel. Henry also has a half-sister from his mom's previous relationship. As the first son, Henry had an unorthodox approach to dressing as a toddler, which worked for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2ba503c4e2d87df3677bf76e09db7ff7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Heidi Klum and Henry Samuel at a basketball match between Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, on November 15, 2017. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel Bears Strong Resemblance to Dad Seal Who Gave Him a Name with Deep Meaning</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Henry was born on September 12, 2005, a year and four months after his older sister, <a class="me a" href=#>Leni Olumi Klum</a>. His extraordinarily long name carries <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/celebrating-c-2-3/>a lot of significance</a>: His first name was taken from the second half of Seal's real name, Sealhenry, while Günther is Heidi's father's name.</p><p class=dh>Ademola was taken from one of the singer's family names. Dashtu, which means two, is the only one of Henry's names that is original to him, chosen by Seal. Dashtu represents Henry as their second child and a convoy of fighter jets, Heidi revealed on the TBS talk show, "Conan."</p><p class=dh>She also spoke about how people say Henry looks exactly like his father and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/heidi_klum_chat-2/>nothing like her</a>. She spoke to People about their twin-like resemblance, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instyle.com/news/heidi-klum-family-sons-seal>saying</a>, "He looks like Seal, and I think Seal is very hot and very handsome. He looks just like his dad—he has this little gap here in his teeth."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ce236fe657d14b714afd010cdce61336.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Henry Samuel, Heidi Klum, and Johan Samuel are seen watching a basketball match between contenders New Orleans Pelicans and Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center in LA, California, on April 1, 2015. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel Rocked Fashion in His Early Childhood</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>As a child, Henry was already <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/celebrating-c-2-3/>dressing to impress</a>. He already owned fashion-forward items, such as an Eliza Gran shirt worth $32, City Threads big guitar T-shirt worth $31, an Ed Hardy bee jacket worth $90, Birkenstock Jawa Camo sandals, an Ed Hardy flock Tee, and rode around in a Maclaren Rally twin stroller.</p><p class=dh>Henry was comfortable in boys' and girls' clothing as he shared a large costume closet with his half-sister, Leni. His mother spoke about how he enjoyed playing dress up, even wearing Leni's princess dresses, and added that she thought the elegant dresses <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/heidi-klum-children/>were more fun</a> than his Buzz Lighter costumes.</p><p class=dh>In 2001, she commented on Henry's untamed fashion sense, saying that they went out for dinner dressed to the T, and he casually wore a pair of dinosaur slippers that he could barely walk in. Henry's mom revealed that he lived in his own world and wore whatever he saw fit, hence the Dino slides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0b5134bcb81c1d2378d300ba3d562dbd.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Leni Klum, Henry, and Johan Samuel at a basketball match between New Orleans Hornets and Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center in LA, California, on January 7, 2011. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel Has Grown into a Handsome Young Man but Keeps Away from the Public Eye</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>When Henry was 11 years old, his mother spoke about the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instyle.com/news/heidi-klum-family-sons-seal>dashing looks</a> he and his brother Johan inherited. She noted that they were both very tall and thin after jokingly disclaiming that she probably should not say that her boys were "very sexy."</p><p class=dh>Heidi added that she believed she would have no choice but to guard them against the flock of girls they would attract when they got older. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instyle.com/news/heidi-klum-family-sons-seal>concluded</a>, "there's going to be a line around my house." Heidi is protective over her children and maintains that approach in parenthood till today.</p><p class=dh>Henry's mother is a public figure who shares photos of and with her son on social media. However, she never exposes his face or <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BXtIbCTgX6l/>that of her children</a> unless the post is a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/CiaNVMYra_-/>throwback photo</a> of the 17-year-old in his adorable toddler days. She is living up to her promise of fending off the ladies.</p><p class=dh>Henry's parents have <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFC66ixp6Lt/>treasured him since birth</a>. They have always allowed him to express himself freely, sparking his creativity and unorthodox persona with an extraordinary name. Heidi's fashion sense has trickled into his dinosaur shoe-wearing style, and Seal's features are copy-pasted onto his mug.</p><p class=dh>Over time, Henry became an older brother to his brother Johan and sister Lou. We have also provided insight into the life of <a class="me a" href=#>Savannah Dickinson</a>, who, like Henry, is also a child of a model who ventured into a role as a judge on a talent show alongside model and mother <a class="me a" href=#>Kimora Lee Simmons</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnaWhiZnqpsc2rsGafnqm1pr6MmpuepZ%2Bhrm6wwKyfra1dqK6uwcSlZKKrXZe2b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
