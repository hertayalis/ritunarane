The portrait shows Markle standing in the middle of a forest of towering redwood, with the sun shining in the background.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The caption was also written by Harry. "Thank you New Zealand for the most wonderful last week of our tour. It has been a privilege to meet so many friendly Kiwis," he wrote. "Australia, Fiji, Tonga and NZ—we leave feeling inspired and reminded of how every single one of us can make a difference."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He closed with a quote from Kate Sheppard, a suffragist and women's rights activist from New Zealand in the late 19th century. "The rain that refreshes the parched ground, is made up of single drops," Harry quoted.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During their visit to New Zealand, the couple celebrated the country's 125th anniversary of women's suffrage, and Meghan gave an empowering speech on feminism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Days earlier, Meghan also took a photo of Harry that was shared on Kensington Palace's social media. The shot showed the Duke of Sussex rehearsing his speech for the Invictus Games in Sydney.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry also took a picturesque photo that was shared on the Palace's Instagram story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the couple doesn't have their own public social media accounts, it's nice to see them getting involved with Kensington Palace's official posts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry and Meghan also aren't the only photographers in the family. Their sister-in-law Kate Middleton is an avid fan of photography and even snaps the official portraits of her children that are released on their birthdays.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Meghan Markle On Becoming a Mom" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/gettyimages-1052214048.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
