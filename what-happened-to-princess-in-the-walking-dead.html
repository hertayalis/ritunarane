The key beats of the season eleven part three premiere included the citizens of The Commonwealth getting up in arms about the death of April as a result of Sebastian Milton’s vile actions, Daryl and company being pinned down by Hornsby, and Negan’s arrival at The Commonwealth to aid the gang’s escape.</p><h2 id=h-so-what-s-princess-up-to data-injectable=false><strong>So what’s Princess up to?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/template.png><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Princess fans need not fear for her life, at least just yet. When we last caught up with the quirky gal she was seen having a conversation with Mercer about the guilt he is carrying about deep-sixing two of his men and covering it up.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>As an honorable man who likes to play by the book, this has been eating Mercer up – and Princess is there to offer words of comfort, as she knows a thing or two about compartmentalizing heavy things that have happened throughout her life.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>While Princess and Mercer’s relationship is definitely interesting enough to warrant more screen time, it isn’t unusual for characters on The Walking Dead to get sidelined for an episode or two, sometimes more. In case you’re new to this series, eleven seasons in, plot points tend to unfold slowly, and when they do, a large chunk of screen time is dedicated to digging deep into them.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Put simply, it seems the showrunners deemed the ramping tension between Hilltop and Alexandria versus The Commonwealth to be a more pertinent plot point to dig into than whatever Princess has been up to off in the background. She wasn’t the only character absent in the season eleven part three premiere, with Eugene also being notably offscreen while Jerry rounds up Judith and the other kids to stow them away safely while the adults work out a way to slip out of the Commonwealth.</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Episode 17, ‘Lockdown’, wrapped up with Carol reuniting the Miltons, presumably as a bargaining chip to get everyone out of the Commonwealth safely, while Daryl, Maggie, Aaron and Gabriel managed to get the drop on Hornsby. With seven episodes to go, things are starting to heat up for one last big battle – and we’re sure Princess will be getting involved in one way or another.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZaCntq%2BvxKyqZqGeYsGpsYywmKWjmaO0brDEmpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
