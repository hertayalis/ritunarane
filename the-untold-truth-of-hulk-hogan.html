Your parent can probably afford to make your diapers out of stitched-together $100 bills, but you inherit a spotlight that shines brightest in your darkest hour. For Hulk Hogan's son, Nick, the spotlight must have been blinding in 2007.</p><p>You may remember Nick from the reality show Hogan Knows Best. Unfortunately, he wasn't the Hogan who knew best. <a href=#>ABC described</a> him as a "sort-of real-life Dennis the Menace." But he was more of a speed demon who didn't know when to hit the brakes. Unsatisfied with simply burning rubber as a racecar driver — which Nick also did — he would frequently speed on the street, sometimes breaking 100 mph. Tickets didn't deter him, and sadly, his best friend, John Graziano, paid the price.</p><p>In August 2007 then-17-year-old Nick got drunk and decided to get behind the wheel of a Toyota Supra with Graziano in the passenger's seat. Law enforcement later accused Nick of street racing, though he denied it. Regardless, he plowed into a tree, leaving Graziano, an Iraq War veteran, with severe brain damage. Graziano's father was understably livid, remarking, "What al Qaeda couldn't do to my son, [Nick] did in a matter of minutes." Nick received an eight-month jail sentence. The Graziano family received an out-of-court settlement, much of which <a href=#>Hulk Hogan paid</a> out-of-pocket.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k3JoanBfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2dwq23jKGmoJmeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
