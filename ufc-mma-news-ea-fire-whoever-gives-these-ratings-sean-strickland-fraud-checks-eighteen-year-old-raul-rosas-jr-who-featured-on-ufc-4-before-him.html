In his second UFC fight, he took control in the first round after attempting multiple grappling attempts at Rodriguez. But the latter was saved after the round had finished. From then on, it was all Christian Rodriguez.</p><p>Rodriguez took control of the fight in the last ten minutes as he took Rosas Jr. multiple times and mounted on the teenage fighter. He landed several blows, which saw him earn the decision and win the fight. Rosas Jr. was visibly upset at his performance as Bruce Buffer announced the winner.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Sean Strickland takes a shot at ‘El Nino Problema’</h2><p>‘Tarzan’ Strickland is often known for his controversial opinions and statements. However, this time he decided to diss the 18-year-old Rosas Jr and downplayed his 4-star rating in the ‘UFC 4’ video game. He shared a post on Instagram and wrote:&nbsp;“So now that I’m in the game I’m invested. EA fire whoever gives these ratings lol grappling 2.5 stars. Striking 1.5 health.. 3.5…. what would you rate him? Just hire me I’ll do it for free lmao.”</p><p>The ‘UFC 4’&nbsp;video game consists of over 336 fighters with different versions of several fighters. Sean Strickland rejoiced in the fact that he is also a part of the roster in the game according to the recent update. But he doesn’t feel like Raul Rosas Jr.’s 4-star rating is legitimate and thinks the ratings are fraud. He has urged the game developers EA to reconsider the 18-year-old’s ratings.</p><p>‘Tarzan’ may not agree with EA’s ratings. But Raul Rosas Jr. is still very young, and it is too early to assess his UFC stint so far. He has only two fights under his belt and will probably improve as time goes by. We will have to wait and see what ‘El Nino Problema’ has in store for his fans.
