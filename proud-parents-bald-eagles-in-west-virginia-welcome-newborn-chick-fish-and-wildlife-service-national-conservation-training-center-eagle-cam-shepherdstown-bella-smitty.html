Bella and Smitty then went viral last week after the FWS posted a video of the two animals moving sticks around the nest and preparing the habitat for their offspring.</p><p>"This bald eagle family needs you to stop scrolling and watch as they perform their branch manager duties," the FWS said on Twitter.<br></p><p>The video currently has over 500,000 views.</p><p>Their journey to parenthood hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows though — officials said "drama" took place after it appeared another eagle was attempting to take over the nest.</p><p>Officials say the nest has been active since 2003, and the eagle cam first came on the scene in 2005. Eagles return for the winter season sometime around mid-January and lay eggs in early February.<br></p>The eagles are wild birds, and anything can happen in the wild," the FWS <a href=# title=https://www.fws.gov/office/national-conservation-training-center-facility/nctc-eagle-cam class=themeColorForLinks>says on its site</a>. "NCTC does not interfere or intervene, and allows nature to take its course.
