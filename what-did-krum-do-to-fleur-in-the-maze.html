During the task, Barty Crouch Jnr, posing as Alastor Moody by way of the Polyjuice Potion, managed to place the Imperius Curse on Viktor as part of his plot to steer Harry Potter to victory in the Tournament.<h2>What curse is Krum under in the maze?</h2>In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Viktor Krum uses the Cruciatus Curse on Cedric in the maze under the Imperius Curse.<h2>Why did Fleur do so badly in the Triwizard Tournament?</h2>Fleur Delacour failed to finish the second task because she was attacked by the grindylows. Because Delacour failed to finish, she never retrieved her younger sister, Gabrielle.<h2>Does Fleur survive the maze?</h2>Being in last place, Fleur was to be last to enter the maze behind Harry Potter, Cedric Diggory, and Viktor Krum. However, due to the machinations of Barty Crouch Jnr — disguised, via Polyjuice Potion, as Alastor Moody — Fleur did not last long.<h2>What Happened to Fleur Delacour & Viktor Krum After The Goblet of Fire ? (Harry Potter Explained)</h2><p></p><h2>Where did Fleur go in the maze?</h2>So in The Goblet of Fire (Movie) The four contestants are in the maze. Fleur Delacour is stunned by Viktor Krum. Before Viktor goes for Harry we see Fleur being covered in branches and vines. The next time we see her she is being pulled under the hedge.<h2>Who did Viktor Krum marry?</h2>He married fellow student Athena Eliopolous in 1997, with Pietro as his best man. Krum retired from Quidditch after a disappointing loss to Egypt in the 2002 World Cup, being narrowly beaten by Seeker Rawya Zaghloul, securing Egypt a 450-300 win.<h2>What happened to Viktor Krum's eyes?</h2>Despite his skills, the Irish side were too good for the Bulgarians, and Viktor decided to end the match by catching the Golden Snitch. During his pursuit of the Snitch, he was hit in the face by a Bludger which broke his nose and gave him two black eyes.<h2>How did Cedric beat his dragon?</h2>Cedric Diggory tackled the task first, against a Swedish Short-Snout. He used a Transfiguration spell to change a rock into a dog to distract the dragon. He was partially successful; the dragon took the bait, and Cedric went for the Golden egg.<h2>How much older is Bill than Fleur?</h2>Fleur Delacour is at most 21 when she marries Bill Weasley, who is a bit older, at 26. Although we don't know exactly when Harry and Ginny get married, Ginny was 22 and Harry was 23 when they had their first child, which means that we can probably guess that they got married a year or two earlier than that.<h2>Was Krum possessed in the maze?</h2>Yes, this exactly. Barty, as the transfigured Moody, patrolled the maze as a prof, thus was able to cast Imperious on Krum unbeknownst to others to ensure that it was Harry that got to the cup (portkey).<h2>Why does Barty Crouch Jr tongue?</h2>It was added into the movie because they needed to give foreshadowing to the audience that Barty Crouch Jr was impersonating Mad Eye. In the book, they use other methods of foreshadowing, (eg winky, more development with Barty Crouch Sr, etc).<h2>What did Igor Karkaroff do to the Goblet of Fire?</h2>In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Karkaroff also turned in Barty Crouch Jr. for torturing Alice and Frank Longbottom.<h2>Could Cedric have been saved?</h2>In the books, Harry saves Cedric from Krum who is using the cruciatus curse due to being under the imperious curse. Ivy is only in the movies. In the books Harry saves Cedric from a giant spider, which in turn attacks Harry and nearly kills him, as they both rush towards the cup.<h2>How did Voldemort turn into a baby?</h2>Pettigrew mixed up a potion for Voldemort using unicorn blood and the venom of Nagini. With this potion, they were able to create a new body for Lord Voldemort to finally return to. However, this body was not what Voldemort needed to return to his fearful leadership form. Instead, it was that of a scaly, hairless baby.<h2>Why can Voldemort touch Harry?</h2>In the graveyard in the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort was able to freely touch Harry without harm once he possessed Harry's blood (which contained Lily's sacrificial protection).<h2>Who else has won the Triwizard Cup?</h2><p>Participant(s)</p><ul><li>Harry Potter (1994 Champion, Hogwarts, Joint-Winner)</li><li>Cedric Diggory (1994 Champion, Hogwarts, Joint-Winner)</li><li>Viktor Krum (1994 Champion, Durmstrang)</li><li>Fleur Delacour (1994 Champion, Beauxbatons)</li></ul><h2>Who put Harry's name in the Triwizard Cup?</h2>Barty Crouch Jr. Used A Powerful Charm To Put Harry's Name In The Goblet Of Fire. The Triwizard Tournament traditionally featured one student from each of the three schools in attendance. That trio of Champions wasn't allowed to be under the age of 17 based on the age spell that Dumbledore put in place.<h2>How did Cedric find out about the egg?</h2>He regularly brought all his possessions into the bath with him. I figured it's Moody/Barty who told him, just to help Harry with the egg. Just like he did with every other task, always acting through somebody else. It was Barty, he told Harry this later on.<h2>What spell does Ginny use in Order of the Phoenix?</h2>Behind the scenes<p>In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, only Ginny casts the Reductor Curse to smash the shelves in the Hall of Prophecy, instead of every D.A. member present.</p><h2>Why did Barty Crouch Jr want to see Harry's arm?</h2>In the scene where Barty Crouch Jr. is revealed (movie, not books) to have been impersonating Mad-Eye Moody, Barty makes a weird remark: I'll show you mine if you show me yours. He then sticks his arm out to show the Dark Mark.<h2>Was Lily Potter a Muggle?</h2>Harry Potter's mother, Lily Evans, and his best friend, Hermione Granger, were Muggle-born. Unlike children of wizarding families who receive their Hogwarts acceptance letter via an owl, a Hogwarts employee will usually hand-deliver the letter to Muggle-borns in order to meet their Muggle parents and explain.<h2>What Muggle did Cho Chang marry?</h2>After the Second Wizarding War, Cho became a renowned healer at St Mungo's and later married a Muggle named Dr. Campbell they had a daughter called Hannah. She later on got divorced and married Draco Malfoy and had two kids with him.<h2>What house is Fleur Delacour in?</h2>Fleur Delacour = Slytherin. She's always trying to be the and act the best in any situation. Her Ambition in being the most dominant in the room propels her and she is fiercly loyal to her family like many Slytherins are.<h2>Who died at Bill and Fleur's wedding?</h2>The Patronus then announced that the Ministry of Magic had fallen, as it had been taken over by Voldemort. The Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour was dead and the Death Eaters were currently on their way.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1llJ6xbrfRrqRmnJ9iwbB5xaWcrqpdnrtuwMeeZKaZqpo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
