Alexander, passed away on December 9, 2023 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is with a great deal of sorrow and heaviness in our hearts that we share the news of his loss. There is a hole that cannot be adequately described as a result of Brian’s leaving, and we are sharing this news with the utmost sense of grief. His bereaved parents, Phil and Wanda Alexander, who live in Bosque Farms, New Mexico, are the only people who will remember Brian after his passing.</p><p>His sisters, Denise Alexander of Corpus Christi, Texas (Robert Coonrod) and Marcy Aquilar of Albuquerque, New Mexico (Tony, Madison, Acen, and Alex), also hold his memory dear. They are the ones who cherish his memory. Furthermore, his aunt, Nelda Spradlin, who resides in Show Low, Arizona, is a testimony to the enormous impact that Brian had on those individuals who had the good fortune to experience his presence in their lives. The warmth of Brian’s soul, the humour he brought into our lives, and the love he shared with his family and friends are all things that we remember as we celebrate his life.</p><p>His presence brought us a great deal of happiness, and the memories that we made together will remain ingrained in our hearts for all of eternity. As we make our way through this challenging period, we take comfort in the love and support of those who are immediately surrounding us. There will be a subsequent communication regarding the specifics of memorial services and the various ways in which Brian’s memory will be honoured. We are grateful for the outpouring of compassion and thoughtfulness that we have received from our friends, family, and members of the community at this difficult time.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrtGimKdlkaGyua3NnZyrZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZpqVobKvec2mZJuqmZa7bq3Lnq%2BappSav260wKxkrJmUocZuvMCsqp6cXZbEosWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
