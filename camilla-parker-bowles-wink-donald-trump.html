The queen even gave a toast to the first family and honored "the continued friendship between our two nations" at a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g27702742/trump-state-banquet-buckingham-palace-photos/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="state banquet" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">state banquet</a> later that evening. But when Camilla broke the fourth wall, it was as if she was letting us in on the joke. As <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/04/camilla-wink-trump-britain-queen/?utm_term=.2482f88cab5b" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Washington Post" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Washington Post</a>'s Isaac Stanley-Becker put it, the wink "came off as an acknowledgment that the spectacle was really unfolding."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Was she letting us know that their happenings with Trump were as ridiculous as they looked? Or, as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://royalcentral.co.uk/uk/charlesandcamilla/was-camillas-wink-a-cheeky-cry-for-help-when-meeting-president-trump-123333 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="some speculated" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">some speculated</a>, was it a cry for help?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In truth, Camilla, who's known to be quite amiable with the royal press pool, was probably just being friendly to the photographers, but that didn't stop Twitter users from spreading the wink around like wildfire.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For some commenters, the seemingly cheeky gesture was enough for them to approve Camilla as the future queen consort. (Her husband is next in line for the throne.) For others, the wink seemed to make up for the years of drama following Prince Charles and Princess Diana's divorce. Even non-royal fans were impressed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The telling reactions didn't end at tea. During the state banquet yesterday evening, viewers said Camilla looked less than entertained while President Trump gave a speech to guests.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We'll happily keep all eyes on Camilla's facial expressions for her future public appearances.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
