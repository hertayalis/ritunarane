He began actively seeking out vintage bikes and other vintage finds and eventually opened Antique Archeology in Le Claire, Iowa, in 2000, and a second location in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2011.</p><p>Wolfe’s reputation for finding hidden gems brought him to the attention of The History Channel, and his show “American Pickers” premiered in 2010, attracting more than three million viewers.
