Now a sprawling, citywide conspiracy thriller punctuated with bursts of majestically balletic violence, Iko Uwais’ Rama is a fresh-faced rookie no longer, but a hardened veteran – even though the story picks up immediately afterwards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-raid-2-1.jpg><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>With his family at risk, the intrepid police officer goes undercover and imprisoned to befriend the son of a local crime lord, putting his life on the line once again in order to tear down an empire from within. To be honest, we’d have been sold on The Raid 2 on the back of characters named Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man alone, but Evans offers so much more.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>It might be a touch on the lengthy side at 150 minutes, but it’s every bit as good as its predecessor, largely due to the fact it’s not interested in replicating the formula. Instead, it’s a bigger and gnarlier beast, one that’s leaving Netflix subscribers with their jaws on the floor.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=false>As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>, The Raid 2 has been bludgeoning the streaming service’s viewership charts since returning to the platform with a vengeance, and the only bad thing we can really say about it is that Evans has effectively confirmed there isn’t going to be a threequel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGaan6Oybr7ArauippdirqTAyKilZquVpsKmuIyerZ6qqWKvqsCMmqpmn5%2BksW6t0magratdmLmiv9Kimmaoopqxpq%2FErKqoql2ZsqS1zJqrnqtdqbWmec2eq5%2Bkma16s63NpKpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
