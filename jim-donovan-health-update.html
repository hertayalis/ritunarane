But the goal is got to get better. I’ve got to get healthy, got to move on. I know the deal. I’ve done it before and I plan to do it once again," he said, confirming that while he will still continue his work at WKYC and on the radio, there will be some absences.</p><p style=text-align:left>"There are going to be periods of time where I might not be with you. That might be for a day, might be for a longer period of time. We’ll just have to see how the treatment plan goes and see how I react to it all," Jim said.</p><p style=text-align:left>Both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WKYC President and General Manager Micki Byrnes</a>, as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleveland Browns' owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam</a>, released statements supporting and honoring Jim after his difficult announcement.</p><p>Sending our best to Jim himself, his wife Cheryl, and his daughter Meghan during this difficult process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auecOopaiukaN6qbHApauhZaWlsaLAxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
