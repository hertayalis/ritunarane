He wasn’t happy about Seth Rollins revealing that conversation with Aalyah, and he said he will speak to the Monday Night Messiah about it. Then he went on to deny that there is anything going on other than a simple conversation.</p><p>“Listen, no comment. You see, what Seth did, he should not have done, and me and Seth were going to have words about that. You see, I follow everything Seth does, I follow the Greater Good. I’m all for the Greater Good”</p><p>“What Seth did by taking my phone and showing the world private conversations, we’re going to have words. But me and Aalyah, no comment. Since when is it a crime to message someone and see if they’re OK? I’m getting shunned, I’m getting crucified, for just checking on someone’s well being. There’s nothing sneaky about it. It’s a private conversation between two people.”</p><p>We will have to see how things turn out in this situation. WWE was dropping hints for the past two weeks that something is going on. Now that it came to light there is a lot of explaining to do.</p><p><a href=#>Alexa Bliss also caught lot of heat from fans</a> when she supported Murphy “shooting his shot” with Aalyah Mysterio. <a href=#>She had to defend herself multiple times </a>throughout the night from angry fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>September 29, 2020 10:02 am</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
