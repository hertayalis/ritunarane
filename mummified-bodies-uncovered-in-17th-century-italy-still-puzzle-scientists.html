Not that mummies are well-hydrated, but the skin of the mummies of Venzone helps explain the natural mummification process. <a href=#>Atlas Obscura</a> describes the fungus in the tomb where the mummies were found — in the former Chapel of San Michele (Saint Michael) — as a type of parasitic mold called "Hipha Bombicina Pers" that quickly dehydrates flesh and slows decomposition. The Vintage News points out that not enough of the fungus was found in the tomb to fully account for the mummification, saying that the limestone floor likely played a role, as well. But still, the precise mummification process remains a mystery.</p><p>The mummies weren't found all at one time. The first one to be found in 1647 was dubbed "Gobbo" — Italian for hunchback — because of its posture. Locals apparently thought the mummies were gifts from God meant to protect Venzone, as <a href=#>Weird Italy</a> says. They remained locally known for about 300 years until Jack Birns, an American photographer in the 1950s, roamed into the village at night looking for a room and promptly stumbled across an elderly man drinking tea with his mummy buddy. Birns brokered some kind of photo op deal, and the world got its first glimpse of the mummies in Life Magazine, propped up for poses in the hands of locals.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kWtvb2tjZLq2ucyinaKdlGKvsLDInqpmrZ6YvLex0Z6bZqGeYn54wMdmmp6mpKq%2FunnIrZilsV2owaq4y2anrrKqobJuv8KinKesmajBtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
